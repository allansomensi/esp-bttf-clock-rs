# Contributing ðŸš€

Thank you for considering contributing to the ESP BTTF Clock! Your help is vital for this ESP32 clock to continue evolving and becoming even more amazing for everyone.

## How to Contribute

Here are the steps to get you started with contributing.

### 1. Fork the Repository

Start by **forking** the repository to your GitHub account. This allows you to make all the necessary changes in a safe environment without affecting the main project.

### 2. Create a New Branch ðŸŒ±

To keep your work organized, create a new branch for your contribution. This makes it easier to separate different features or fixes. Use a name that clearly describes what you're doing, like `feat/new-led-theme` or `fix/sntp-sync`.

```bash
git checkout -b your-feature-branch
```

### 3. Linting and Code Quality ðŸ§¹

Before submitting your changes, please make sure that your code follows the project's coding standards. I recommend using the `just` command to perform linting and check your code with **Clippy**. To do this, run:


```elixir
just lint
```

This will ensure your code is free of common issues and adheres to the project's style guidelines.

### 4. Testing ðŸ§ª

Whenever possible, include tests for your new feature or bug fix. Tests help ensure that the clock functions reliably and stably.

### 5. Submit a Pull Request ðŸ“¤

When your code is ready, submit a pull request (PR) to the main branch. To speed up the review process, please:

- Use a clear and descriptive title.
- Explain what was changed and why the change is necessary.
- If your PR fixes a specific problem, reference the corresponding issue number (e.g., `Fixes #123`).

I greatly appreciate your collaboration. Small improvements, bug fixes, or major features are all welcome!

Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
